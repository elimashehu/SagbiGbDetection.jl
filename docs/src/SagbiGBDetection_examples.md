# SagbiGbDetection

A julia package for finding the term order for which the given generators of an ideal form the Gröbner basis or the given generators of a finitely generated subalgebra of a polynomial ring are the SAGBI basis. If there is no such term order, then the given set of generators of an ideal or subalgebra is not a Gröbner basis or SAGBI basis respectively for any term order

# Gröbner Basis Detection


## Introduction

SagbiGbDetection allows to compute the term order for which the given generators of an ideal form the Gröbner basis. 


## Functionality

The first main functionality of this package includes ```weightVectorsRealizingGB(G, R)```. A function for extracting the weight vectors for which the given set of polynomials is a Gröbner basis.

Given a set of polynomials (G) and a polynomial ring (R) as input, the function produces an array of weight vectors for which the provided set of polynomials adheres to the Buchberger Criterion. It also yields a Boolean value, which is 'True' when the set of polynomials constitutes a Gröbner basis for all weight vectors, and 'False' when it does not.
  
```julia
using SagbiGbDetection
```

```julia
julia> R, (x, y) = Singular.polynomial_ring(Singular.QQ, ["x","y"])
(Singular Polynomial Ring (QQ),(x,y),(dp(2),C), spoly{n_Q}[x, y])

julia> G = [y^2-x, x^2-1]
2-element Vector{spoly{n_Q}}:
 y^2 - x
 x^2 - 1

```

```julia
julia> weightVectorsRealizingGB(G, R)
(Vector{ZZRingElem}[[2, 2]], false)
```

```julia

weightVectorsRealizingGB(G::Vector{spoly{n_Q}}, R::Singular Polynomial Ring (QQ))

Provides a set of weight vectors, which may also be empty, for which the provided 
vector of polynomials 'G' serves as a Groebner basis. Additionally, it returns a Boolean 
value indicating whether this is a Groebner basis for all the weight vectors generated by the method or not.

# Arguments
- `G::Vector{spoly{n_Q}}`: input generators.
- `R::Singular Polynomial Ring (QQ)`: polynomial ring over Q.
```

## Examples

```julia

julia> using SagbiGbDetection

julia> R, (x, y) = Singular.polynomial_ring(Singular.QQ, ["x","y"])
(Singular Polynomial Ring (QQ),(x,y),(dp(2),C), spoly{n_Q}[x, y])

julia> G = [y^2-x, x^2-1]
2-element Vector{spoly{n_Q}}:
 y^2 - x
 x^2 - 1

julia> weightVectorsRealizingGB(G, R)
(Vector{ZZRingElem}[[2, 2]], false)
```


# SAGBI Basis Detection


## Introduction

SagbiGbDetection allows to compute the term order for which the given generators of a finitely generated subalgebra of a polynomial ring are the SAGBI basis. 

## Functionality

The second main functionality of this package includes ```weightVectorsRealizingSAGBI(G, R)```. A function that identifies weight vectors that meet the SAGBI criterion for a specified set of polynomials.

Given a set of polynomials (G) and a polynomial ring (R) as input, the function provides an array of weight vectors that satisfy the SAGBI criterion, along with a Boolean value indicating whether the SAGBI criterion is met for all weight vectors, where 'True' signifies compliance and 'False' denotes non-compliance.

```julia
    weightVectorsRealizingSAGBI(G::Vector{spoly{n_Q}} and R <: Polynomial Ring over Q)

Returns an array of weight vectors, which may also be empty, for which the provided vector of 
polynomials 'G' constitutes a SAGBI basis. It also provides a true or false message indicating whether 
this is a SAGBI basis for all of the weight vectors generated by the method or not.

# Arguments
- `G::Vector{spoly{n_Q}} and R <: Polynomial Ring over Q: input generators.
```

## Examples

```julia

julia> using SagbiGbDetection

julia> R, (l, x, y, z) = Singular.polynomial_ring(Singular.QQ, ["l","x","y","z"])
(Singular Polynomial Ring (QQ),(l,x,y,z),(dp(4),C), spoly{n_Q}[l, x, y, z])

julia> G = [z, z*x, z*y, z*x*(x^2+y^2),z*y*(x^2+y^2), l*z, l*z*x, l*z*y, l*z*x*(x^2+y^2), l*z*y*(x^2+y^2)]
10-element Vector{spoly{n_Q}}:
 z
 x*z
 y*z
 x^3*z + x*y^2*z
 x^2*y*z + y^3*z
 l*z
 l*x*z
 l*y*z
 l*x^3*z + l*x*y^2*z
 l*x^2*y*z + l*y^3*z

julia> weightVectorsRealizingSAGBI(G,R)
(Vector{ZZRingElem}[[1, 2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 1]], true) 

```


# Extract Weight Vectors

To define different term orders, the function ```extractWeightVectors(G)``` computes the Newton polytope of the set of given generators ```G``` and for each vertex of the polytope, it decides if the normal cone to this vertex intersects the positive orthant. If this happens then it selects a weight w in the intersection which serves as a term order in the detection algorithms.

```julia
julia> extractWeightVectors(G)
2-element Vector{Vector{ZZRingElem}}:
 [-2, -2]
 [-3, -1]
```

# S-polynomial

Given two polynomials f and g the function ```Spair(f, g)``` computes the S-polynomial. 

```julia
julia> Spair(G[1], G[2])
-x^3 + y^2
```
# Buchberger Criterion and SAGBI criterion

Given a set of polynomials GS in a ring R, the function ```BuchbergerCriterion(GS, R)```  is for checking the Buchberger criterion for the set of polynomials GS.

```julia
julia> BuchbergerCriterion(G,R)
true
```
Similarly, ```SagbiCriterion(G, R, w::Vector{Int})``` is a function for checking if a set of polynomials satisfies the SAGBI criterion.
